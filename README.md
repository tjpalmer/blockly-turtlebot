=================

TurtleBot control via Blockly scripting, using roslibjs.

WARNING!!!
Always secure your network or robot access before running any network exposed
robot control system.

See tutorials for roslibjs and rosbridge_server for how to get things up and
running.
I'll try to provide more details here as things progress and as time permits.
